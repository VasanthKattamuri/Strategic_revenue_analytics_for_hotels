# Strategic_revenue_analytics_for_hotels-

This project helps AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain, analyze their revenue data and regain their lost market share. Using Power BI, DAX queries, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we’ve built an interactive dashboard that provides insights into their historical performance.

The goal is to give the management clear, actionable insights to make better decisions on improving revenue. Metrics like Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), Average Daily Rate (ADR), and Occupancy Rate were calculated and visualized.

We also uncovered additional insights that weren’t part of the original request, such as the impact of seasonality on revenue and profitability comparisons across different hotel branches.
